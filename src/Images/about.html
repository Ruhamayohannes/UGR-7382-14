                Hi there! I'm Ruhama, an enthusiastic junior software engineer
                based in the vibrant city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. With a
                deep-rooted passion for technology and innovation, I've embarked
                on a journey to make a significant impact in the tech world.
              </p>
              <h3>Experience</h3>
              <p>
                My journey in software engineering began during my university
                years where I engaged in various challenging projects. These
                projects ranged from developing small-scale web applications to
                participating in collaborative software development, providing
                me with a solid foundation in coding, teamwork, and project
                management.
              </p>
              <h3>Achievements</h3>
              <p>
                I've successfully led a team to victory in a national coding
                competition, where we developed a novel application addressing
                local community needs. This experience not only honed my
                technical skills but also enhanced my leadership and strategic
                thinking abilities.
              </p>
              <h3>Awards</h3>
              <p>
                In recognition of my academic and extracurricular dedication, I
                was awarded the 'Excellence in Innovation' award by my
                university. I've also received accolades from various tech
                communities for my contributions to open-source projects.
              </p>
              <h3>Hobbies</h3>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, I immerse myself in the world of
                literature, exploring the realms of fiction and philosophy. I'm
                also an enthusiast of cinema, particularly fond of the
                storytelling and cinematography of early 2000's movies.
              </p>
              <h4>Invitation</h4>
              <p>
                I am always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations
                in the tech space. Whether it's a start-up project, a community
                initiative, or a tech talk, I'm excited to connect and share
                ideas. Feel free to reach out for a chat or collaboration!
